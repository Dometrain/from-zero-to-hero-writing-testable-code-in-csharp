# From Zero to Hero: Writing Testable Code in C#

Welcome to the ["From Zero to Hero: Writing Testable Code in C#"](https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-writing-testable-code-in-csharp/?ref=dometrain-github) course on Dometrain! 

This course teaches you how to write .NET code that's easy to test. You'll learn why testable code matters and what makes code "testable" in the first place. The course covers four main strategies: creating clear behaviours, keeping responsibilities focused, managing dependencies properly, and reducing side effects.
This course helps both new and experienced developers write better, more maintainable code that's easier to test and less prone to bugs.

This repository contains the source code for the course, which you can use to follow along.

## Getting Started

The **main branch** contains the most up-to-date version of the code, reflecting the latest improvements, updates, and fixes. 

Each section in the course has folder in the repository. The folder contains the source code for the section, containing both a `/start` and `/end` directoryâ€”which aligns with the source code at a point in time as it relates to the course.
